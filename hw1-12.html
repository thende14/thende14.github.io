<h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>

<p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.

But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products,

and they've become quite a hit.</p>

<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures,

stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on

all things Halloween.</p>

<h2>Product categories</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="products/props.html">Props</a></li>

<li><a href="products/costumes.html">Costumes</a></li>

<li><a href="products/special.html">Special Effects</a></li>

<li><a href="products/masks.html">Masks</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>My guarantee</h3>

<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it

for a full refund. <strong>No questions asked!</strong></p>
