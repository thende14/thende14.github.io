<div> <h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h2></div>
  
<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
  
<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween
pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep
you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
